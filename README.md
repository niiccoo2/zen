Zen lets you block apps with specific requirements.

Right now I'm working on the basic blocking functionality that lets you block apps permanently, temporally, or on a schedule.
One the basic app blocking is in place, the plan is to add AI features that will let you make even more customizable blocks.

Example:

User: Block Youtube until I finish my math homework.
AI: Can you send a picture when you are done?
User: Yes.
AI: Okay, I will block youtube until you send a picture of your completed math homework.

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A WAY TO UNBLOCK APPS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. Right now, I'm going to add different levels for the blocks.
Each level will have different requirements to cancel. Ex. Easy: Cancel anytime. Medium: Wait on screen for x minutes before canceling. Hard: Donate $1 to cancel.
